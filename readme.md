# Calendar Telegraf Bot

Example of a bot that is using [telegraf-calendar-telegram](https://github.com/gianlucaparadise/telegraf-calendar-telegram).

## Hook setup

You can call `GET https://telegraf-calendar-telegram-bot-gianlucaparadise.vercel.app/api/telegram-hook?setWebhook=true` to setup the webhook. This operation needs to be performed only once, after the first deploy.

# Reference
